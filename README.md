Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles and practices to design, testing and maintenance of software systems.
Software engineering serves as the backbone for the development of reliable, efficient and innovative solutions in the technology industry
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The introduction of object oriented programming like python c++, Java which led to a more scalable, maintainable codebases.
The rise of agile methodologies came as a response to the limitations of traditional waterfalls which led to long development cycles and inflexible project
The introduction of DevOps: DevOps is a set of practices that combine software development and IT operations to shorten the development life cycles and provide continous delivery with high quality
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning: This is the initial phase which defines the scope and purpose of the project, which includes feasibility analysis, timeline, estimation and risk management.
Design: In this phase, the system's architecture is created. it includes the overall system design and other detailed system specifications.
Implementation: This phase involves the actual coding of the software.
Testing: This phase is dedicated to verifying that the software works as intended.
Deployment: After the successful teating, the software is deployed to the production management.
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is ideal for projects where requirements are clearly defined and unlikely to change like developing a regulatory compliance software for the healthcare industry, where requirements are dictated by laws.
Agile is ideal for projects that are expected to evolve over time such as developing a new consumer-facing mobile app, where user feedback can drive changes and new features.
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developers are the programmers which are respnsible for writing, testing, and maintaining the code that makes up a software application.
Quality assurance engineers are responsible to ensuring that the software product meets the required quality standards. And their responsibilities usually comprises of test planning, manual testing, bug reporting,etc.
Project manager is responsible for planning, executing and closing software projects.
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Enviroments provide a comprehensive enviroment where developers can write, edit, debug and test all codes within a single interface and an example of such IDEs is Visual Studio.
Version control systems allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously without overwriting each others changes, and such example is Git.
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Dealing with changing requirements and best strategy for this is to adopt the agile methodologies.
Accumulating technical debts, shortcuts, one of the best strategy is refactoring, whereby regularly refectoring codes to improve its structure and reduce complexity without changing its functionality.
Security vulnerabilities can have severe consequencnes and its best to adopt security best practices by conducting regular security audits.
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing involves testing individual components or units of a software application in isolation.
Integration testing involves combining individual units or components and testing them as a group to ensure that they work togother as intended.
System testing involves the complete and integrated software application as a whole.
Acceptance testing is the final phase of testing before the software is released to the customer.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting and refining prompts—inputs or questions—given to AI models, especially language models like GPT, to elicit specific, accurate, or useful responses. It involves carefully choosing words, structuring sentences, and providing context to guide the AI in generating the desired output.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
An example of vague prompt "Tell me about climate change."
An example of a well improved prompt "Explain the main causes of climate change and its impact on coastal cities over the next 50 years."
The improved prompt clearly specifies what aspect of climate change should be addressed ("main causes" and "impact on coastal cities"), reducing ambiguity and ensuring that the response is focused.
